#### Q&A

1.How would you describe your approach to client service?
 
Aside from the obvious, which is highest standards in dealing with clients, such as fair dealing, and putting client interests first, I would insist on communication - fair, clear and frequent. 

Information needs to flow both ways, it needs to be taylored by client needs and his level of understanding. 
Some clients are more risk averse than they claim, in the sense that they like the idea of taking risk, but lose their patience quickly when they face losses. They need to be reassured and on the opposite channel, their fears need to be understood and if necessary, steps must be taken towards getting closer to meet their needs, epsecially if they face particular constraints (such as pension funds for ex., who have hard and soft constraints and have to meet liabilities). 

Other clients ignore the risk and fail to see the incumbent losses, especially if they receive quarterly reports and have complicated company structures.

In my experience I always stood ready to provide performance updates or estimates. I regularly answered phone calls in which I had to provide detailed explanations on performance and even performance expectations sometimes.   

2.Provide an example of a time where you identified a unique recommendation to better meet a client objective – how did this recommendation also align with the internal corporate objectives?

At my last job, my recommendations were usually aligned with internal objectives. My former CEO was very experienced, and I had so much to learn from open discussions with him regarding how to achieve client objectives. I was his right hand in providing data support or opposition to his investment ideas. Many times I was acting like a risk manager, holding back on some risky ideas. I didn't have the decision power but the data and facts I provided always had an impact on the final decision.   

I have few examples of cases that didn't work ideally, such as when I was on maternity leave in Q1 2016 and the company launched a long-only strategy trading small gold-mining companies -  the risk was tremendous, and had I been there, I would have provided detailed analysis and simulations to enable an accurate view of the risk profile of this investment. 

Another example was when the CEO and onther analyst released a small article regarding the oil price capacity to rebound from a certain low (back in 2016). They concluded that in seven prior cases the price doubled in less than a year. I drew the attention to that, while the finding was correct, it was incorrect to make inferences based on this, due to the low number of observations. When we built confidence intervals around their prediction, we found we could only predict that the price would be higher in one year, but not by how much.

There were of course times when someone else perceived risks before me (such as the unreliability of published analyst forecasts around turning points). We usually turned all these unwanswered questions we had into research articles. 
 

3.How do you approach investigations? Provide an example of the steps you took to identify a particular risk (relating to a long-term investment) in the past.


I start by looking at historical behavior, and then I perform simulations. If there is a complicated structure, such as a structured product, I try to outline the risk factors. Once we had to analyse a portfolio of structured products for our client, on a consultancy basis. The products were mainly "Worst-of". At maturity the payoff would have been "the worst of three equities' performance". We made 10000 simulations of the terminal values for his holdings, starting from where they were at that point, and found out there was almost no case in which this holding would result in a gain at maturity. We recommended the client to redeem the products and cut losses.    
 

4.Describe your experience working with external research partners.
 

 I used external research a lot, from academic and professional publications, from Bloomberg, Reuters, and so on. We also partnered with banks as external asset managers so I was often reading their publications  - LODH, UBS, Credit suisse and so on. When I was in trouble and I needed help with a more difficult problem I wouldn't hesitate to ask my former PhD colleagues, who were better prepared than I was and were now teaching at famous universities - LSE, SSE, Oslo and others. Such was a case when I asked Cecilia Bustamante about the implications of using IRR instead of TWR, and we wrote a paper rebuffing a book that had just come out, by Simon Lack. (I can send you the paper). We had conversations and conf calls with the Association of Asset Managers who came up with their own rebuttal paper on this book, taking slightly different arguments that ours. I guess their arguments were better, but we were the ones that brought the idea to their doorstep. 

5.Describe your experience developing investment policy or governance best practices. Provide specific examples.

Developing investment policy was unfortunately not among my attributes. I wish I could do an IPS from the start just to test my knowledge from the CFA level 3. Regarding governance best practices, the CFA Code of Conduct was my bible, and our company adopted, at my suggestion, the CFA Institute Asset Manager Code of Conduct. 
 

6.Elaborate on your experience in trend analysis. Provide examples.

I have experience working with time series, including stochastic processes (Brownian motion, mean-reversion, jumps, etc -  lately I freshened my memory of these while studying Python). I'm used to getting my hands dirty with raw data, and making all kinds of regression analysis and statistic inferences, all the way from my bachelor studies through masters to PhD course through my professional work. I have used Excel data analysis, various econometric packages, Matlab and recently Python. 


7.Do you have any experience working on an investment research or strategy team? Provide an example of research or strategy you developed that resulted in elevating business, in your previous roles.

I have been employed as Head of Research at Insch, which was more than just a glorified title for Senior Financial Analyst, because more than half of the work time was on pure research: independent research on financial markets and securities, investment research on our products and ideas, monthly newsletter on recent market developments, and not in the least confidential research and recommendations for client portfolios.  

I couldn't evaluate the impact of my role but it was essential in conducting the Insch business. 

We made a goal of publishing monthly research articles, and in the beginning we very rarely missed a month. Some of our articles were published in professional journals. In later years, our research has become less frequent than monthly, but I believe the quality of it improved. 
 

8.How are markets impacted by different events? Provide a variety of examples.

See some of the Insch publications: 
	- impact of Central Bank policies on the levels and variability of exchange rates
	- impact of Central Bank policies/raising balance sheets on gold prices 
	- increased risk in bond investments in the aftermath of the financial crisis and the low-interest rate environment. 


9.What is your experience with portfolio construction or monitoring of mixed assets? What involvement have you had relative to policy development, benchmarking, investment restraints, modelling client trades, and proposing allocation transactions? Describe your experience in providing research and recommendation for new investment strategies or products.

I have provided support to portfolio management by contructing portfolio proposals and recommendations to the CEO. I have also back-tested an optimized out-of sample trading strategies using matlab.

I constructed the cashflows for the sinking fund investment that our compnay did when it leased oil-producing properties in Canada.
 

10.Describe your experience in developing long-term investment themes - how did you identify the opportunities and risks for your clients?

My approach has been more critical than embracing of investment ideas. The investment ideas often came from clients and from our CEO, who was much more experienced and more knowledgeable than me in the practice of financial instruments, soemtimes we found them in literature, other times from our competitors and relations within the industry. My role was predominantly to verify the validity of these ideas, and many times I was the one who warned against the risk involved in these investments. 
 

11.Describe your experience working with cross-functional teams – how do you build the most effective relationship with colleagues?
 
Being friendly and sociable. We communicated and cooperated but not stepped on eachothers' toes. Within our small team we split responsibilities. We were more like a commando in structure, where everyone applied his own strengths in areas where he felt more comfortable. A colleague of mine was responsible of the IT part - the trading functionality, managing the website, after a while also the email distribution and the social network presence. With my other fianncial analsyst colleagues we sometimes split the client portfolios that we were analysing in our consultancy business, followed by cross-checking eachother. However, we were always willing to lend a helping hand, advice and suggestions. The main source of advice and suggestions was anyway our CEO. 


12.Do you have experience preparing research briefs – i.e., product summaries) 

Yes, I have regularly produced product factsheets, perfomance factsheets, detailed risk reports, product presentations and flyers.  
 

13.Do you have experience mentoring junior staff or interns? What is your approach?

Yes, from my TA in the academy to my Lecturing in Portfolio Management, followed by mentoring students in the CFA Institute competition. At Insch CM I had to mentor 4 interns, at different times, of which two went on to become full-time employees. 

My approach is to treat them like grown-ups, provide feedback, and allow them to bring their own input in the investment recommendations. 

My CEO told me: we are not in the business of managing people, we are in the business of managing money. They are the ones who have to adapt. I guess he was right for a small company, but a large company like BCIM surely need protocols and tools in place for managing people.
