I am an experienced and knowledgeable Financial Analyst with a working interest in Risk Management. I have a work permit for BC and I look forward to resuming my career in finance, after an almost 4-year stay with my family in NY. While unemployed, I homeschooled my kids, I learned Python, and I attended online courses in Finance. 

In March 2021, I started to volunteer at the CFA Society Victoria for the Financial Literacy Project, an initiative aimed to help certain demographics that are underserved by professional financial advice.  

My work experience includes nine years of experience in the alternative investment sector, four years in accounting, and two years in academics. I hold a Master of Advanced Studies in Finance (Financial Assets Management and Engineering) from the University of Lausanne, HEC, and Masterâ€™s degrees in Economics from UPF, Barcelona, and CEU, Budapest.

My last full-time position was Head of Research with Insch Capital Management SA, in Lugano, Switzerland. There, I coordinated research and reporting, prepared client presentations and marketing materials, back-tested investment ideas, built trading strategies, performed NAV reconciliation, client service and operations, and performance/risk analysis.

Our research was often published in financial journals and magazines. [Here is a non-comprehensive list of our publications.](research0.md)  

Before that, I was a Senior Financial Analyst with DL Investment Partners, an investment advisor for public pension funds, in Switzerland. In that position, I performed manager selection, due diligence, qualitative and quantitative analysis, NAV reconciliation, and tailored client reporting. 

I have additional experience as Teaching/Research Assistant, and Mentor/Grader for the CFA Institute GIRC competition. In 2010 I was invited to teach two Masters' courses at Toulouse ESEC Business School - Portfolio Management and Risk Management.
