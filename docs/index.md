I have a work permit for BC and I look forward to resume my career in finance, after a 4 year stay with my family in NY. While unemployed, I homeschooled my kids, I learned Python, and I attended online courses in Finance. 

In March 2021, I started to volunteer at the CFA Society Victoria for the Financial Literacy project, an initiative aimed to help certain demographics that are underserved by professional financial advice.  

I have almost 15 years of work experience, of which nine in the alternative investment sector, four in accounting, and two in academics. I hold a Master of Advanced Studies in Finance (Financial Assets Management and Engineering) from the University of Lausanne, HEC, and Masterâ€™s degrees in Economics from UPF, Barcelona, and CEU, Budapest.

My last full-time position was Head of Research with Insch Capital Management SA, in Lugano, Switzerland. There, I coordinated research and reporting, prepared client presentations and marketing materials, back-tested investment ideas, built trading strategies, performed NAV reconciliation, client service and operations, and performance/risk analysis.

Our research was often published in financial journals and magazines. [Here is a non-comprehensive list of our publications.](research0.md)  

Prior to that, I was a Senior Financial Analyst with  DL Investment Partners, an investment advisor for public pension funds, in Switzerland. In that position, I performed manager selection, due diligence, qualitative and quantitative analysis, NAV reconciliation, and tailored client reporting. 

I have additional experience as Teaching/Research Assistant, and Mentor/Grader for the CFA Institute GIRC competition. In 2010 I was invited to teach two Masters' courses at Toulouse ESEC Business School - Portfolio Management and Risk Management.
