I have almost 15 years work experience, of which 9 in the alternative investment sector. 

My most important role so far has been Head of Research with Insch Capital Management SA, in Lugano, Switzerland.

I initially joined InschQuantrend, the research arm of Insch, in Dec.2010, and subsequently moved to Insch Capital Management. As Head of Research I have coordinated research and reporting, back-tested investment ideas performance, prepared client presentations and marketing materials, performed NAV reconciliation and risk analysis on multiple asset classes. 

Our research was often published or mentioned in financial journals and magazines. [Here is a non-comprehensive list of our publications.](research0.md)  

Previously, I have worked as Senior Financial Analyst for pension fund investments with DL Investment Partners in Zug, Switzerland. In that position I have performed manager selection, due diligence, qualitative and quantitative analysis, and dedicated client reporting. 

I have experience in the academy as Research Assistant, Teaching Assistant and Mentor/Grader for the CFA Institute GIRC competition. However, the highlight of my academic carrer was teaching two courses at Masters' level for Toulouse ESEC business school, Portfolio Management and Risk Management.
