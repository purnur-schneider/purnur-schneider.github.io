Say the risky investment yields returns r_1 in the first period and a different r_2 in the second period.

The difference in the total returns between the risky and the riskless investments is the volatility drag: </p> <p>(1+r_1)(1+r_2) - (1+r)^2 = -(1/4)(r_1-r_2)^2, always negative. </p> <p>For Geometric Brownian Motions, expected total return has the expression E(R) = \\mu - \\sigma^2/2, where -\\sigma^2/2 is the volatility drag. </p> <p>If leverage is applied, so exposure is increased by a factor n, the volatility drag term increases by the factor n^2. </p> <p>A trading strategy could aim to minimize the volatility drag by decreasing exposures when high volatility is expected and vice versa.</p>"},{"location":"research1/#with-dl-investment-partners","title":"With DL Investment Partners","text":"<ul> <li> <p>I have performed Returns-Based-Style-Analysis, to track eventual style drift by individual foreign exchange managers.
